This repository contains a full end-to-end pipeline (Implemented using Snakemake) which automates the prediction of CSF flow velocity from fMRI inflow signals at the 4th ventricle.

A core feature in this framework is training on synthetic data generated by the model we previously published:

**Ashenagar et al., 2025**  
[Modeling dynamic inflow effects in fMRI to quantify cerebrospinal fluid flow](https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.9)

This is still in development and so I have not added the actual snakefile which is used to run the pipeline.
